Information related to the Applied Physics Degree

The APSC APP Flowchart and program plan is for just the Applied Science - Applied Physics degree.  The ASAP ME flowchart shown is for the dual Mechanical Engineering - Applied Science degree but does show the courses needed for the physics degree.  I hope to add flowcharts for other dual degrees in the near future so check back.

If you are interested in seeing how this would work for your situation, I'm happy to make a draft 5-year graduation plan to share with you.  Email me or stop by my office.
