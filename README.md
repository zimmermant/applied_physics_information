Information related to the new B.S. in Physics and the double-major options

Some of the files say Applied Science or Applied Physics - these are old files but the info is still relevant.   Files prior to 2024 are mostly correct and can be used for planning in Stellic.  These will be updated soon.

If you are interested in seeing how this would work for your situation, I'm happy to make a draft 5-year graduation plan to share with you.  Email me or stop by my office.
