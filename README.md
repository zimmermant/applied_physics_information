Information related to the Applied Physics Degree

The APSC APP Flowchart and program plan is for just the Applied Science - Applied Physics degree.  The ASAP ME flowchart shown is for the dual Mechanical Engineering - Applied Science degree but does show the courses needed for the physics degree.  I hope to add flowcharts for other dual degrees in the near future so check back.
